--------------------DA RIFARE--------------------

Ben was 6 y.o., he was very attached to his grandmother. She used to tell him about how she liked to sneak out of home at night, run till the middle of her parents' field and just lie on the grass looking at the stars: there were a lot more stars, you know? Back in my days...'. She was fascinated by the night skies full of those tiny shiny points and the flow of colors from black to bright milky white to dark blue.
Now, Ben is a little guy, he's not brave nor ???, but he's curious. He can't believe those tales even though he heard them over and over. He gets up from bed before midnight, he silently dresses up, he puts on his shoes and, without the slightest of the noises, he comes down the stairs and leans toward the back door of his grandparents' house. His grandfather was a farmer and just like all farmers he had the set of tools of a handyman, surely there was a torchlight as well. Ben opens the drawer where he knew he could find those things and grabs a torchlight.
Ben's grandmother is awake, she knows what is going on and she's proud that Ben didn't, indeed, just heard her stories, he listened to them. She doesn't stop him, she doesn't say a word and she lets him leave for the advanture.
